# VueExamples
In this repo you will find a set of example applications to demonstrate the usage
and functionality of Vue.js, most of the examples have a more detailed article which is linked to 
in the corresponding doc file. 

I made this repo in the first instance for myself as a sort of sandbox to test new ideas
and Vue things, as well as a lookup guide to see the components in action and 
to write down some pitfalls. Hopefully you guys have some benefits as well.

Everything is open for discussion, if you have ways to improve the examples
code wise, documenting things or requesting/contributing a new example .
 
When contributing try to follow this [style-guide](https://github.com/pablohpsilva/vuejs-component-style-guide). 
Clean and uniform code is a joy for everyone.
